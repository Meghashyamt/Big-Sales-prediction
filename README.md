BigMart Sales Prediction: Approach Note
My solution for the BigMart sales prediction challenge follows a structured machine learning
workflow:
1. Data Understanding & EDA:
o Analyzed distribution of sales data and found it to be right-skewed
o Identified missing values in Item_Weight and Outlet_Size
o Examined relationships between sales and predictors like Outlet_Type and
Item_MRP
o Noted that Supermarket Type1 outlets have higher sales variance
2. Data Preprocessing:
o Handled missing values: median imputation for Item_Weight, mode
imputation for Outlet_Size
o Standardized inconsistent categories in Item_Fat_Content
o Addressed zero visibility values with product-type-specific means
o Created meaningful features like "Outlet_Years" from establishment year
3. Feature Engineering:
o Created price segments (Item_MRP_Binned) to capture price range effects
o Simplified Item_Types into broader Item_Category (Food, Drinks, NonConsumable)
o Combined encoding strategies: label encoding for high-cardinality features
and one-hot encoding for low-cardinality features
4. Model Selection:
o Evaluated multiple regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost
o Used 5-fold cross-validation to ensure model stability
o Selected the best performer based on RMSE (likely Gradient Boosting or
XGBoost)
5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
o Optimized key parameters for the best model using RandomizedSearchCV
o Focused on parameters most likely to impact performance: tree depth,
learning rate, etc.
6. Feature Importance Analysis:
o Identified most influential predictors of sales
o Item_MRP, Outlet_Type, and Outlet_Location features typically show high
importance
